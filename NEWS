v1.7.2

v1.7.0
    * support "default" bg/fg in shapes
    * add basic KHAOS shapes
    * workaround http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=114567

v1.6.0
    * add gallery support to add dia shapes to the OOo gallery

v1.5.1
    * fix crash due to changing vector from underneath reference

v1.5
    * rearrange textbox code to use the shapes defined box rather than
      that of the .dia seeing as dia totally ignores whatever appears
      in the file in favour or the .shape one
    * resize shapes that are too narrow to contain their text, like dia does
    * snap connector line endpoints to their connector positions and recalculate
      their routes.

v1.4
    * dia image paths are relative to the user's home dir, convert
      them relative to that dir to file:// urls
    * refactor to split shape importer into a template/importer to
      split state out into template and leave importer stateless
    * add connection points to FlowChart Diamonds
    * expand the page size if the diagram doesn't fit on a single page
    * Model zig-zags and fallback to Polylines if we determine that
      OOo can't route them they way they should be

v1.3
    * Make zig-zags into connectors, add line-skew for them
    * add connection points to FlowChart Boxes

v1.2
    * Dia has a different idea about font-sizes, so do the best
      we can to output a font-size that matches it
    * Implement paragraph alignment
    * Get connection points to shape-templates working
v1.1
    * added group support
    * added arrow support
