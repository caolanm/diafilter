openoffice.org-diafilter is an import filter for .dia and .shape format
diagrams for OpenOffice.org.

openoffice.org-diafilter is released under GPLv3 or later.

Some parts of openoffice.org-diafilter are based on code from openoffice.org
itself under the LGPLv3

To be useful openoffice.org-diafilter must parse .shape files distributed with
dia, itself released under the GPL

To build you need: 
a) The openoffice.org sdk, e.g. the openoffice.org-sdk package under
RHEL/Fedora)
b) The shapes files distributed with dia, e.g. install dia and they should now
be available as /usr/share/dia/shapes)
c) set your OpenOffice.org build environment
i.e. under RHEL/Fedora use
source /usr/lib*/openoffice.org/basis*/sdk/setsdkenv_unix.sh 
d) now build with..
make DIA_SHAPES_DIR=/usr/share/dia/shapes

To install:
The output is .oxt file called "diafilter.oxt" in the build dir
install this for the current user using...
unopkg add build/diafilter.oxt
To install system-wide for all users then as root use...
unopkg add --shared build/diafilter.oxt

To uninstall:
Use unopkg remove mcnamara.caolan.diafilter
or for a system-wide extension unopkg remove --shared mcnamara.caolan.diafilter
